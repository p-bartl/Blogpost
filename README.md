## 2. Project Motivation

I have choosen a Dataset of my own: The Data of the PISA 2012 Assessment. Specifically, in the past there has been a 'PISA Data Visualization Competition' and the orignal Dataset which has been used can still be downloaded:

**About the Survey Date:**<br>
PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.

**Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally.** Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy.

I am interested in how the four independent variables
- 'Gender', 
- 'Age at Start of Primary education', 
- 'Age at First use of computers' and 
- 'Out-of-School Study Time - Homework'<br>

affect various dependent variables such as<br>

- qualitative factors ('Satisfaction') as well as 
- quantitative factors ('Score in Mathmatics')

**Specifically, I am going to address the following Questions but I am going to explore other Correlations as well:**

- Do students who use Computers first early in their Life spend more time using the Computer?
- Do male Students make use of Computer programming more frequently?
- Does spending more time on Homework translates into higher Scores in mathematics and is there a Gender-Difference?
